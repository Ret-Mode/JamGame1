--Plot--
The main character is fighting his way back to the future. However, he/she knows that if he/she changes anything in the past
he/she will never get back to the same universe that he/she was and eventually he/she will not has his/hers revenge.

Main goal - build time machine and return to our universe right after the trial (in time).

Luckily, as an engineer, we know what elements we need to create time machine.

Proposed time periods of our fights, bosses and collected materials:
- prehistory    - T-Rex                  - bone of strongest dino (hull of time machine)
- antiquity     - Roman turtle formation - best damask steel (gears)
- middle ages   - heavy cavalry          - relic (element marked with time-travel)
- (our) present - tank                   - petrol (fuel)
- near future   - mech                   - computer (calculation device)

Alternative wacky bosses for each age:
- stone tank pulled by dinos
- Roman/Greek god
- dragon or inquisition
- medical experiment failure (some kind of mutant)
- alien
